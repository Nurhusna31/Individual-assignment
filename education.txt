<p>I started my education in 2006 when I'm 5 years old. I got my first education at Tadika Agama Johor (TAJ).</p> 
<p>After I finished my first education, I continued to take second education in the same school.</p> 
<p>The teacher that educated me and my friends is teacher Rubiah and teacher Monaliza.</p> 
<p>These two people are very kind, polite and work hard to make their students understand when they are teaching at the class.</p>
<p>I’m proud because I can be a student from these teachers.</p>

<br>
<p>After that, when I finished kindergarten, I continued my education in primary school. At this level, I have two sessions school to go, in the morning and evening.</p>
<p>The primary school name is Sekolah Kebangsaan Seri Merlong. This is the school's name for morning sessions. After that, Sekolah Agama Seri Merlong is the school name for evening sessions.</p>
<p>When I was in year 1 until 3, the class name was MAWAR & ROS, but when I was in year 4 until 6 the class name changed to CERDIK & PINTAR.</p> 
<p>The class names at evening sessions are Al- Muttaqin and Al- Musyrikin.</p>
<p>At this level, I meet a lot of friends from many villages around the school and we create a lot of moments together.</p>
<p>I’m sorry I cannot provide a picture for evening school sessions because I did not find any picture from those class sessions.</p>

<br>
<p>We continue at the secondary school level. At this time, I attend school at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Parit Betak. This is the daily school.</p> 
<P>In addition, this school is very close to my house, that is why I choose this school to continue my education.</p> 
<p>This level taught me how to become a good person in life, I got kind friends and also kind classmates. I’m glad because I can meet all of them even though we come from different schools.</p>

<p>This course has 4 semesters to go through and now I’m in the last semester for diploma level.</p>
