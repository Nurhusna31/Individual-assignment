<p>In 2018, I become a babysitter for my aunt's granddaughter.</p>
<p> I've been doing this job for around 3 month while waiting for my spm result. When I take care of her, I was 1 years old and her name is Ayra Nur Sofia.</p>
<p>I remember, It was very hard to handle children especially during sleeping time. Sometimes she do not want to sleep but I need to forced  her to avoid from get less sleep.</p>
<p> I take care of her at my parent house only because they house is very close with me. Her mom is working as a nurse, so every weekend only, she will take her child.</p>
<p>Alhamdulillah, during my work, I got RM300/ month. The salary I will share with my family. The experience make me realise, it hard to get a money.</p>

<p><font color="brown">Secondly, In 2020, I was work at the Mak Roha factory. My job is doing the roll of batang buruk snack.</p>
<p>I'm doing this job when the semester breaks around 3 month. Every month I will get RM 300- 400 based on how much I get when doing the batang buruk roll.</p>
<p> For this experience, I know about traditional food and know how to make it. It was a very wonderful experience.</p>

<p>Lastly, my experience when practical at Tunku Tun Aminah Library in february 2021.</p>
<p> This practical take 6 weeks to go through and learn about how to handle the library and know the function of each department.</p>
<p>The experience I get will be a knowledge for me in future if I become a librarian. Insha Allah.</p>
